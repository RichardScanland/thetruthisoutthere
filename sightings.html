<h2>Sightings of the Week</h2>
<h4>"Lights in the Sky" reported by Sarah H.</h4>
<p>"I was walking home from work one night and I just so happened to look up at the sky to see these weird orange lights in the sky that looked like they were moving around each other in a cirlce. Then they streaked away and dissapeared. When I got home to Google whether there was supposed to be a meteor shower that night, there wasn't."</p>
<h4>Our Response</h4>
<p>Hey Sarah! That definitely sounds like a UFO! Remember readers, "UFO" stands for "Unidenfitied Flying Object" and does not mean it was an alien spaceship. However, this sighting is very odd and does not sound like an earthly occurance. Thank you for your submission!</p>
<h4>"I saw a Man in Black" reported by Anonymous</h4>
<p>"There has been a person wearing black walking by my house every day for the past week. I say "person", but I'm not sure if that's the correct term. Their skin is completely pale and they are completely hairless. I got a brief look at their face and it just seemed...wrong. I don't know how else to describe it other than that. I think it's here because I was looking into a bunch of local alien stuff."</p>
<h4>Our Response</h4>
<p>Hey Anon! Your "Man in Black" sighting does corrolate with what others have said about them, and I hope you're not too spooked. However, I wouldn't get too alarmed just yet. Talk to the person. They might just be a normal person that doesn't get a lot of sun.</p>
